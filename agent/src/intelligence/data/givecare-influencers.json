It’s a system designed to help families stay organized and find trusted help.\n\nwe’re building tools that make life easier for caregivers, starting with the magic magnet + tendercard.\n\nthese are free scannable QR codes (one for the fridge, one for your wallet) that give first responders instant access to your loved one’s emergency info: medications, allergies, conditions, and contacts. plus, your family gets a text alert the moment it’s scanned.\n\nthese were built with EMTs, trusted by families, and 100% free.\n\ncomment “tendercare” and we’ll send you one!",

That kept him thinking I was just fine and not always asking” ~ Helle\n\n“I worked as a Program Manager in a Memory Unit for 8 years. Hand Massages were wonderful. I used The Aroma Therapy Lotion from Bath & Body Works. It was always interesting to see how each patient responded to my touch and the scent of the lotion. If they liked the scent I would rub a small amount under their nose. That way the scent and feeling might linger for a while. Hand massages can be very relaxing and human touch is so important. Another idea I used was for the families bring in a blank photo album and pictures of individuals that their loved one knew at one time in their life. First I would go through the pictures with the patient to see if they remembered their names. When I put the pictures in the album I would include a label with the name of the person. I was looking for 2 things. 1. If the patient was still able to read and say the name and 2. If the patient remembered anything about that person. ~ Susan \n\n“Near the end, when my mom was losing the ability to swallow, I bought a tiny food processor and made “snow” out of water. I’d place a teaspoon of the snow in her mouth & it would quickly melt. It worked beautifully! I think you could freeze any liquids, like broth etc... freeze them into cubes & do the same.” ~ Carol",

              "caption": "🧺 Here are some tips for Sorting and Donating..\n👚Start Small (Initially I went to my mom’s closet but it was overwhelming and made me sad so I stopped). \n- Instead, begin with one drawer or one category (sweaters, pajamas, etc).\n- Don’t rush, this isn’t just decluttering, it’s processing memories.\n🎁Keep a “Memory Box”\n- Choose a few special items that capture their essence — a favorite sweater, a church outfit, or a gardening hat.\n- Label them or take photos of your loved wearing them, so those memories stay tangible.\n🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒Involve Family When Possible\n- Invite siblings, kids or grandkids to choose something that reminds them of their loved one. \n- Sharing stories as you sort can turn grief into connection.\n🤲Be Intentional About Donations\n- Choose organizations that align with their values (e.g., women’s shelters, senior centers, or Alzheimer’s thrift programs).\n- Knowing the clothes will help someone else can make the process meaningful.\n♥️Respect Their Dignity\n- If your loved one is still aware, include them. Let them touch or look at things before they go.\n- Even if they don’t fully understand, the act of involving them honors who they are. #alzheimers #alzheimersdisease #dancingformemories",

It taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of self-care. I cared for both of my parents while raising kids and working full-time. Now, I'm my brother's remote primary caregiver while juggling my own business (I miss the paid time off!). Tom was born with ASD and IDD. He lives in a community for those living with disabilities about an hour from me.\n\nFor almost eleven years, I’ve been on a mission to help other caregivers prioritize their own well-being while they care for others. And, I'm practicing what I preach, too!\n\nIf you’re looking for tips, laughs, or someone who gets it, you’ve found your corner of the internet!\n\n🌟 I’m the founder of Happy Healthy Caregiver, a resource hub and community for family caregivers.\n\n🎤 I host the Happy Healthy Caregiver podcast, where I share tips and spotlight other family caregivers.\n\n📚 I’m a bookworm who loves escaping into a good novel or personal growth book and has been a part of a book club for as long as I can remember. I share something I recently read in each podcast\n\n🌸 I swear by my daily “micro-self-care” moments—whether it’s a walk, needlepointing, or purging a cluttered space.\n\n🎶 My happy place? Playing board games with my family while listening to one of their playlists.\n\n🌎 Travel fuels my soul, and I enjoy trying new things. I share one of the favorite things I'm loving in each episode of the podcast.\n\n🐾 I’m a proud pet parent to an almost 15-year-old Shih Tzu and a 5-year-old Doodle, and I believe furry friends are great therapy.\n\nThanks for being here. Is there anyone else you know who could benefit from the content I share and this community? Maybe share this post with them.",

Instead, I've been doing something the past few years that has allowed me to focus on one healthy habit a month. Habits I care about and choose. Maybe I'm adding something nutritious to my life or subtracting something that isn't.\n\nI consider the eight categories of self-care when mapping out my monthly focus: Financial, Social, Spiritual, Intellectual, Professional, Practical, Emotional, and Physical.\n\nYou can do this at least three different ways. \n\n1) Decide up front what habit you'd like to focus on each month \n\n2) Put 12+ habit ideas in a container and draw one out each month for a bit of a surprise. \n\n3) Set a reminder on your smartphone to choose a new habit each month to focus on.\n\nLearn more about this concept and get some habit ideas here: \n\nhttps://bit.ly/HHCpick12",

              "caption": "I'm in a new season of care, and 2025 has been intense. As a solopreneur, when I'm not working on Happy Healthy Caregiver, the work simply doesn’t happen. Juggling that while managing care for my brother, Tom, has stretched me in new ways.\n\nTom lives with disabilities (including ASD) and multiple health conditions. Last fall, we decided to keep him in Georgia full-time for more stability and better support services. He’s been living with another brother an hour away while we’ve coordinated doctors, programs, paperwork, and—most recently—a residential community. It’s been productive, exhausting, and full of bumps and family conversations.\n\nIn May, I started tracking my “Tom hours” to make invisible care labor visible. I’m at almost 140 hours since May—about 5 hours a week—and it still feels like more.\n\nThe good news: in 2025, Tom joined a 2-day-a-week work program, and on Dec 1, he officially moved into a residential community for adults with disabilities. It’s not a perfect solution, and losing full freedom with his car is a big adjustment—but we’re hopeful.\n\nI’m praying we’ve found a place where Tom can age in a healthy, happy way. Your prayers and positive energy are welcome as we navigate this transition. 💛",

              "caption": "3 powerful ways to become a more self-confident caregiver 👇🏼\n\nSometimes, we can be bothered by a sense of imposter syndrome because we second guess ourselves or question our abilities …\n\nHere are a few of the tricks I applied when I was knee-deep in crisis mode, keeping everyone else afloat but torturing myself with self-doubt 😣\n\n1. Trust yourself \n\nListen to your instincts and remind yourself that you’ve already faced and overcome so much. You’ve aced so many things and any ‘mistakes’ have only made you stronger and wiser. Keep a list of achievements nearby to look at if you need a reminder.\n\n2. Question your negative thinking\n\nAsk yourself - “is that thought TRUE?” Take away their power by realising if they’re not true, why would I act on them? Write them down or say them out loud - they seem much sillier out in the open than they do in your head.\n\n3. Visualise a great outcome\n\nSee yourself navigating the situation with confidence and allow yourself to feel proud at this imaginary scenario. You’ll trick your brain into feeling more prepared and more confident to go forward and face the real-life thing - and have a little smile in the process! \n\nSave this post for later and let me know if you found this helpful 💜\n\n—\n\n#endalz #endalzheimers #alzcaregivers #seniorcaregiver #seniorcareadvice #caregivercommunity #caregiverwarrior #caregiversupport #caregiverlife #caregivertips #caregiverstress #selfconfidenceboost #believeinyourselfalways",

If I’m not careful they will run the whole show and before I know it, I’m watching a tragedy with a horrible ending! \n\nMy thoughts run around without any supervision most of the time and the results are usually disastrous. \n\nFear, recrimination, guilt, judgements, and second guessing take place in my head most of the time without any push back from me. \n\nIt’s like I’m in a kindergarten class with open cans of paint all over the room and the kids are allowed to do anything they want! Stuff gets flung all over the place.\n\nSo this is a gentle reminder to myself and anyone who needs to hear it that we can at anytime pause to listen to the noise that’s happening in our heads and take control of it. \n\nEven for a brief moment. \n\nI start by actually listening to what I’m saying to myself. \n\nWow. \n\nThat’s enough to put my hair on fire.\n\nThen I can ask myself if what I’m saying to myself is true (usually not) then is it something that is helpful (usually not).\n\nI then say “hey thanks for the feedback but that’s not really helping me right now” and think about something that brings me relief or joy or something I’ve done that’s awesome. \n\nMind you, (pun) this might only get me relief for a few moments but it’s worth it and offers me a rare opportunity to stop the show my thoughts are putting on. \n\nIt’s  also training me to be aware of the circus in my head and giving me permission to put an end to it.\n\nIf our thoughts are not entertaining us we don’t have to entertain them.\n\nLet remember to get the hook, pull the plug, shut it down and lock them up. It’s like a raid on our brain. \n\nGo for it. \n\nFor more helpful info, head to my website  caregiverwarrior.com and check out my book “Self Care for Caregivers” to get quick, actionable ways to care for yourself at the link below!\nhttps://amzn.to/40cmtiW\n\n#caregiverwarrior #caregiving #caregiver #thoughts #thinking",

It’s helpful to remember that quiet and silence are as effective as conversation when we want to communicate. \n\nCommunication comes in many forms and quiet is one of the most profound forms. \n\nI have always felt safer when I’m in verbal communication. It makes me feel seen and heard and gives me an opportunity to let others feel seen and heard as well. \n\nI truly love a great conversation and believe the more we let others in on how we feel the better life can be. I can chatter. Endlessly. It’s my go to way of reaching out. \n\nI learned something about the ways I reach out to others when I became a caregiver. \n\nCaregiving taught me that open communication is indeed a life saver. But it has also taught me that there are many forms of communication, and many are not  verbal. \n\nYes, with the right tone and great intention, talking to someone is a wonderful way to spend time with a loved one I care for. \n\nThere are often, however, many times when a quiet gesture or a small silence speaks volumes to someone in pain, or fear, or confusion or who is simply tired of it all. \n\nI can send comfort with a smile or a gentle touch or hug or just a calm, waiting silence that says I’m here, I have you, I care. \n\nIt can almost be a relief to just be with someone without trying to fix them or the situation or filling space with words. \n\nI can share my energy and feeling of love simply with my presence. \n\nAnd that can speak volumes. \n\n#caregiverwarrior #caregiver #caregivering #quiet #selfcare\n\nFor more helpful info, head to my website  caregiverwarrior and check out my book “Self Care for Caregivers” to get quick, actionable ways to care for yourself at the link below!\nhttps://amzn.to/40cmtiW",

We only pause briefly and keep moving.\n\nI suggest we pause deeply and take a solid moment to take the weight of the punch in, give ourselves the space to say ouch really loud (cursing has been proven to be helpful) and truly acknowledge that we didn’t deserve it and it really hurts. \n\nIn that space we can also feel upset about it, frightened by it, and thrown by it. \n\nWe are allowed to take the time to steady ourselves until the pain subsides. \n\nWe can be gentle and kind to ourselves \n\nWe can give ourselves credit for taking the blow with grace. \n\nWe can be really proud of how well we handle them and how brave we are. No one takes a gut punch like a caregiver.\n\nOnce we’ve taking the time we deserve to recover and reset, and allow a mini heal, we can find strength and keep moving. \n\nStay bent over as long as you need. You can stand again when you are truly ready. \n\nFor more information and useful content, please visit my website  https://www.caregiverwarrior.com\nI hope you find it valuable!\n\n#caregiverwarrior #gutpunch #caregivers #caregiving #dementia",

              "caption": "Some days start out feeling hard right out of the box. A feeling of dread takes over and it can go downhill from there.\n\nSo before we get stuck in the dread and frustration, we can remind ourselves that it’s just one day, not forever. \n\nWe can do anything for 24 hours. \n\nAnd another 24 hours is a gift no matter how challenging those hours are. \n\nThere just might be a great moment in one of those hours and if we are too wrapped up in how hard it all is, we might be looking the other way and not see that great moment. \n\nAnd even if it seems like there are no great moments and we are just slugging our way through, it will be over soon and today is a gateway to another day that might be totally different. \n\nLife is funny that way. Each day has its own personality. We don’t have to like each one but if we have to work with them we can at least put up with them until we get to work with someone we like a lot. \n\nFor more information and useful content, please visit my website  https://lnkd.in/dUPqppJ \nI hope you find it valuable!\n\n#caregiverwarrior #caregiving #caregivers #onedayatatime",

Grabbed dinner with our girl Rachel & saw Michelle a bunch but my favorite was Grams getting pampered at the hair salon.\n\nIn March I started hiking! It was so good for my mind & body. Spring training came to Phoenix & we got a visit from @terptoni23 And by the end of the month my sister @kacie723 came to visit for Spring Break.\n\nBy mid April we were back in the pool! We celebrated Easter with @our_generation_of_care & her beautiful family then stole her kids got a fun sleepover at our house! \n\nMay was full of hiking & taking care of myself. Celebrating Mother’s Day once again with Michelle & her family. We got to finally meet @leannspecht & started our summer road trip.\n\nIn June we got to watch my niece graduate middle school & celebrate my 38th Birthday with my family. After we did some traveling to Oklahoma where we got to meet our girl @barbie_abigailmarie & visit our caregiver friend @ciarra.holliday \n\nBy beginning of July we were back in Phoenix roasting so we hopped right back in the car to meet my family in South Carolina, where we stayed for weeks. \n\nBy August it was time to party again! We headed to Virginia Beach to see our girl @tashar07 & made our way to NYC where we met @cinnacatxtress & got to see my long time BfF @bethb2142 & cousin @frankiegarafola on Long Island but the fun didn’t stop there because we headed to upstate New York where we had the time of our life at the Lake with @kgorman4 \n\nWe spent September-November staying close to my family in Chicago. We weren’t supposed to be there that long but I went to too many doctors appointments because I neglected my health as a caregiver so it all ended up working out. My mom came to visit & Yoli gave me lots of much needed time off! \n\nWe are finally back in Phoenix loving on each other!",

Skincare is important. If I don’t get it right before football starts, I’m gonna be dry, crusty, and emotionally fragile for the entire weekend.\n.\nSo… what are your game day routines?\nWhat should I actually be doing for my skin?? Drop your holy grails, routines, and miracles below…this 45 yearold queen needs help.\n.\nAlso can someone please tell @coreyreidmartin that I deserve to be beautiful??\n\n#lgbt #grwm #football #nfl #collegefootball",

A realization that it’s my generation’s turn to carry on the family holiday traditions my mom created with so much love.\n\nGrowing up, the holidays were about bringing everyone together with good food, karaoke, and chismis. I used to think it just happened. Now I have so much respect for the effort and love that went into every single Christmas, and how my mom and family showed up, year after year, to create that magic for us.\n\nThe holidays don’t feel exactly the same anymore. We’ve lost some loved ones along the way. But we’ve also welcomed new additions (baby Noa) 💕\n\nNow, It’s our turn to gather everyone around the table, to keep the music loud and the laughter louder, to create that same warmth for the next generation.",
