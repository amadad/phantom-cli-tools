It’s a system designed to help families stay organized and find trusted help.\n\nwe’re building tools that make life easier for caregivers, starting with the magic magnet + tendercard.\n\nthese are free scannable QR codes (one for the fridge, one for your wallet) that give first responders instant access to your loved one’s emergency info: medications, allergies, conditions, and contacts. plus, your family gets a text alert the moment it’s scanned.\n\nthese were built with EMTs, trusted by families, and 100% free.\n\ncomment “tendercare” and we’ll send you one!",

        "caption": "3 powerful ways to become a more self-confident caregiver 👇🏼\n\nSometimes, we can be bothered by a sense of imposter syndrome because we second guess ourselves or question our abilities …\n\nHere are a few of the tricks I applied when I was knee-deep in crisis mode, keeping everyone else afloat but torturing myself with self-doubt 😣\n\n1. Trust yourself \n\nListen to your instincts and remind yourself that you’ve already faced and overcome so much. You’ve aced so many things and any ‘mistakes’ have only made you stronger and wiser. Keep a list of achievements nearby to look at if you need a reminder.\n\n2. Question your negative thinking\n\nAsk yourself - “is that thought TRUE?” Take away their power by realising if they’re not true, why would I act on them? Write them down or say them out loud - they seem much sillier out in the open than they do in your head.\n\n3. Visualise a great outcome\n\nSee yourself navigating the situation with confidence and allow yourself to feel proud at this imaginary scenario. You’ll trick your brain into feeling more prepared and more confident to go forward and face the real-life thing - and have a little smile in the process! \n\nSave this post for later and let me know if you found this helpful 💜\n\n—\n\n#endalz #endalzheimers #alzcaregivers #seniorcaregiver #seniorcareadvice #caregivercommunity #caregiverwarrior #caregiversupport #caregiverlife #caregivertips #caregiverstress #selfconfidenceboost #believeinyourselfalways",
