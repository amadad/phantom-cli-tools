      example: |
        Some weeks feel like a cross-section of a bigger shift.
        Caregiving, aging, AI, policy, and safety—once treated as separate domains—aren't quite converging yet.

        But they need to. This week:

        ➡ Heading to FamTech.org event on The Future of Work & Care
        ➡ Flying to Atlanta for AgeTech Connect Summit
        ➡ Finalizing GiveCare updates (including open source SDOH)

        If you're in NYC or ATL and want to talk care systems, DM me.

        [Name], founder of GiveCare, will [speak/attend] at [Event]

        More context about the event or talk
      example: |
        Every major women's-health disparity has a shadow variable no one models: caregiving load. Once you surface that variable, the outcomes stop looking mysterious.

        Ali Madad, founder of GiveCare, will speak at the HITLAB Fall Summit 2025.

        His talk, Invisible Care, Visible Health: Reframing Family Caregiving as a Core Women's Health Issue, will run December 3, 2025, 11:40-12:00 ET.

        [Optional: why this matters]
      example: |
        Mike George at Soaring Families has turned 30+ years of hands-on caregiving into a practical training program that helps families build and manage a reliable care team at home.

        We're looking forward to partnering—pairing their "build your care circle" approach with GiveCare's SMS self-care and assessments.

        We need more folks doing real, useful work like this.

      description: "Observation or reflection - USES WRITING SYSTEM, no CTAs"
      use_writing_system: true
      structure: |
        USE ONE ENGINE:
        - diagnostic: symptoms → structure → stop
        - procedural: sequence, failure points
        - accretion: stack observations, no thesis
        - boundaries: "this does not… / this will not…"

        USE ONE STRUCTURE:
        - observation_x3: Three observations, then stop
        - consequence_rewind: Result → trace back → hidden decision
        - symptom_list: What people see → misdiagnosis → actual cause
        - counterfactual: Imagine alternative → return

        NO CTA at end. Stop after the observation.
        Include 1-2 human markers (asymmetric emphasis, mild imprecision, one raw word)
      example: |
        Three things happen when you hit signal degradation:
        The small tasks multiply. The response time lengthens. The things you used to do automatically now require conscious effort.

        People call it burnout. Which isn't wrong, but it's imprecise.

        What's actually happening: the feedback loop between load and recovery has broken. You're running on depleted reserves. The system is telling you something, but you can't hear it over the noise of the next task.

        Nobody teaches you to read these signals. We teach resilience instead... which is another way of saying: ignore them longer.
      example_accretion: |
        My father forgot my name on Tuesday.
        He remembered the exact route he walked to school in 1962.
        He asked me three times if I'd eaten.

        The specialist called it "expected progression."
        The insurance form had a checkbox.
        The care plan remained unchanged.

        I made dinner. We didn't talk about it.
      example_boundaries: |
        This tool will not tell you everything is going to be okay.
        It will not remind you to "practice self-care."
        It will not send motivational quotes at 7am.

        What it will do: track the load. Surface the patterns. Give you data when the fog sets in.

        Whether you act on it—that remains yours.
