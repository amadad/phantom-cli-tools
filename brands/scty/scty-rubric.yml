# JUDGE PROMPT (for LLM-as-Judge)
# =============================================================================
judge_prompt: |
  You are evaluating tech thought leadership content for SCTY, an AI studio.

  CONTEXT: SCTY builds AI products (GiveCare), runs experiments, and consults for
  agencies and health tech. The voice is direct, technical, building-focused.
  Not corporate. Not hype. Not obvious.

  EVALUATE this content on 5 dimensions (score 0-10 each):

  1. INSIGHT: Does it offer a non-obvious perspective? Does it reframe something
     or just state the obvious? Would a smart practitioner nod or roll their eyes?

  2. CLARITY: Is it dense with meaning? Could it be said in fewer words? Is every
     sentence necessary?

  3. AUTHORITY: Does it sound like someone who builds things? Or someone who
     reads about people who build things? Is there specificity that only comes
     from real experience?

  4. ORIGINALITY: Is this a fresh take? Or could any tech account have posted it?
     Does it avoid the recycled AI discourse?

  5. ENGAGEMENT: Does it create tension or curiosity? Is there a reason to read
     to the end? Would you remember it?
