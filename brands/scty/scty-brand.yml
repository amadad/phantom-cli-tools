  image:
    style: "technical patent drawings meets theoretical physics visualization meets zine-culture collage. Monochrome or duotone. Declassified research diagrams, speculative engineering schematics photocopied too many times, pseudo-scientific conceptual cartography, retro-futurist cosmic symbolism"
    mood: "clinical precision warped by entropy. Systematic but slightly wrong. A future archive of something never built. Philosophical diagrams from an alternate research institute"
    avoid: [realistic imagery, text, letters, typography, shadows, gradients, stock photography, clean vector art, crude literal metaphors, full color palettes]
    prefer: [patent drawing line weight, circuit diagram aesthetics, waveform interference patterns, technical cross-sections, topology meshes with photocopy artifacts, speculative machine anatomy, particle collision diagrams, electromagnetic field visualizations, elegant technical precision, conceptual cartography with poetic annotations, retro-futurist orbital motifs, bold flat iconic silhouettes, zine collage layering, duotone spot color fields, cross-hatching and stipple rendering, perspective grid vanishing points]

  style: "Monochrome brutalist, experimental graphic design, archival, imperfect, intentional"
  mood: "bold, raw, systematic, experimental"

      - "Brutalist, modernist, experimental graphic design"
      - "Feels archival, printed, imperfect, intentional"

      conceptual_diagram: "pseudo-scientific conceptual map, philosophical cartography — poetic annotations on technical axes, polar coordinates of abstract ideas"
      celestial: "retro-futurist cosmic symbol, orbital paths, horizon lines, vanishing-point perspective grids, star markers, thin single-weight strokes"
      iconic_silhouette: "bold flat silhouette, single-weight iconographic mark, figure or object reduced to pure shape"

    # FORM_MODE toggles (combinable)
    form_modes:
      geometric: "geometric modular forms (circles, quarter-circles, rectangles, grids)"

      techno: "techno geometric, digital grid structures, warp distortion"
      bleed: "soft bleed edges"
      vector: "hard vector cuts"
      duotone: "single spot color (vermillion, deep red, or signal orange) plus black on flat field — large solid color areas as compositional blocks"
      collage: "zine-style mixed-media collage, layered halftone photography with line illustration and bold typographic mass, rough cut edges"
      cosmic: "retro-futurist thin line work — orbits, horizons, perspective grids, celestial arcs, constellation node networks"

    # TEXTURE_MODE options (combinable)
    texture_modes:
      risograph: "risograph grain"
      photocopy: "photocopy noise"

      rotated: "rotated 90° / 180°"
      cropped: "cropped aggressively by frame"

    # BACKGROUND options
    backgrounds:
      white: "pure white"
      black: "solid black"
      spot: "flat spot color field (vermillion, signal orange, deep red) — used with duotone form mode"

    output_intents:
      poster: "poster"
      brand_mark: "brand mark exploration"
      editorial: "editorial graphic"
      identity: "identity system component"
      generative: "generative art base"
      social: "social media post"

    # Composition rules (always applied)
    composition:
      - "Subject OFF-CENTER — pushed to edge, corner, or bleeding off-frame. Never centered."
      - "Aggressive negative space — 40-60% of canvas can be empty"
      - "Element does NOT need to fill the frame. Isolated mark on vast field is valid."
      - "Asymmetrical balance — visual weight through placement, not centering"
      - "Visual rhythm through repetition and variation"
      - "Crop with intention — subjects can bleed off edge or float in space"

    # Depth rules (always applied)
    depth:
      - "Flat graphic plane with implied depth"
      - "Overlapping shapes"
      - "Masked layers"
      - "Transparency through pattern density, not opacity"
