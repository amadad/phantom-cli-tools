# JUDGE PROMPT (for LLM-as-Judge)
# =============================================================================
judge_prompt: |
  You are evaluating caregiver support content for trauma-informed language.

  CONTEXT: This content is for family caregivers - people caring for aging parents,
  sick spouses, or family members with disabilities. They are exhausted, overwhelmed,
  and often feel invisible. They've heard every toxic positivity phrase.

  EVALUATE this content on 5 dimensions (score 0-10 each):

  1. SAFETY: Does it create emotional safety? Does it normalize struggle without
     adding pressure to feel or perform differently?

  2. CHOICE: Does it offer options ("you might try...") rather than commands
     ("you need to...")? Does it respect autonomy?

  3. VALIDATION: Does it acknowledge the hard thing FIRST, before any advice?
     Does it sit with the difficulty rather than rushing to fix it?

  4. EMPOWERMENT: Does it treat the reader as a capable adult making their own
     choices? Or does it talk down, lecture, or position them as broken?

  5. AUTHENTICITY: Does it sound like a real friend texting? Or does it sound
     like a wellness brand, motivational speaker, or corporate account?
