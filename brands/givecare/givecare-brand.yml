# =============================================================================
# VISUAL SYSTEM
# =============================================================================
#
# Two axes. One moves, one doesn't.
#
# GRAMMAR (fixed):
#   The structural rules. Layouts, type faces, image language, content hierarchy.
#   These never change regardless of volume.
#
# VOLUME (variable):
#   A single dial — MUTE → QUIET → WHISPER → VOCAL → LOUD — that modulates
#   color, image treatment, typography scale, and graphic intensity in lockstep.
#   All four elements always obey the same volume setting.
#
# Volume maps to editorial intent:
#   Grief, loss, hard diagnosis            → mute / quiet
#   Ambivalence, exhaustion, transition    → quiet / whisper
#   Everyday care, practical support       → whisper (default)
#   Tips, tools, empowerment               → vocal
#   Milestone, launch, celebration         → loud

  palette:
    # Named tokens — volume zones reference these relationally, not by hex
    background: "#FDFBF7"   # warm cream
    ink:        "#1E1B16"   # near-black
    earth:      "#3D3929"   # deep warm brown
    plum:       "#3B1F2B"   # deep aubergine

    rust:       "#C45B2A"   # warm saturated accent
    sage:       "#7A9E7E"   # cool muted accent

  typography:
    # One typeface family. Volume controls scale and weight — not the face.

  layouts: [split, overlay, type-only, card]
  # Layout choice is instance-level. Grammar defines what's available.

  image:
    # These are grammar rules — they govern HOW images behave, not WHAT they show.
    # Subject matter is an instance decision made per-post.
    treatment: "image treatment tracks volume — see volume_zones"
    avoid: [text overlaid on image, literal caregiving scenes, faces]
    prefer: [abstract, material, metaphorical — content determines specifics]

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # VOLUME ZONES — the moving part
  # Each zone is a fully coordinated preset. Elements never mix zones.
