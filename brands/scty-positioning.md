## What SCTY Is

SCTY is a **studio/lab** that incubates AI products and experiments.

- **Experiments (minors)**: Small tools, open-source projects, prototypes (e.g., PARAsight)
- **Incubations (majors)**: Full products that graduate to their own identity (e.g., GiveCare)
- **Consulting**: AI transformation work for agencies and health tech - funds the lab, informs the product work

## The Pitch

> SCTY is an AI studio. We build AI systems for clients (agencies, health tech), contribute to open-source, and conduct applied research on AI safety and creative applications. The work informs itself - what we learn in research makes our client work better, and client problems drive our research questions.

## Positioning vs. Competitors

| Competitor Type | Their Approach | SCTY Differentiation |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Big consulting (McKinsey, Deloitte) | Enterprise, slow, expensive | Design-informed, builder-led |
| Pure engineering (forward-deployed) | Technical, no strategy | Strategy-through-build |
| Futurists (Amy Webb, etc.) | Trends, no build | We actually ship |
| Agencies | Creative, no AI depth | AI-native, product mindset |

**SCTY's gap**: Design-informed, strategy-through-build, agency-native. The "we actually ship AI products" voice.

## Unifying Themes

The threads that connect all SCTY work:

| Thread | Core Activity |
|--------|---------------|
| Consulting | Building AI systems that work |
| Open-source | Building in public, sharing learnings |
| Creative experimentation | Exploring what AI can become |
| Safety research | Building AI that's responsible |

**The common verb is building** - but with intention, craft, and openness.

### Content Split

| Brand | Content Type | Audience | Goal |
|-------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Ali Madad** | Curation, POV, experiments | Peers, builders, network | Thought leadership, serendipity |
| **SCTY** | Case studies, capabilities, OSS releases, lab updates | Buyers, talent, partners | Lead gen, credibility |
| **GiveCare** | Caregiving content, product updates | Caregivers, health tech | Users, community |

**The unlock:** Ali feeds SCTY. Personal curation/experimentation becomes the "R&D" that makes SCTY credible.

## Growing SCTY Emphasis

Ways to grow SCTY visibility without reducing GiveCare work:

### 1. Make the Lab Visible
- Ship experiments publicly, even small ones
- "SCTY Lab" → ongoing stream of tools, prototypes
- Low-effort content (you're building anyway)

### 2. SCTY as the Narrator
- Write about *how* you're building GiveCare
- The AI architecture, design decisions, safety research
- GiveCare is the case study, SCTY is the methodology

### 3. Reframe Consulting
- Not separate from GiveCare - same skillset, different client
- "We build AI products. Sometimes for ourselves, sometimes for you."

### 4. Experiments as Marketing
- Small public tools attract attention → consulting inquiries
- Shows capability without needing to pitch

## Target Landscape

### Primary Audiences
- **Agency decision-makers**: AI transformation budgets
- **Health tech executives**: Emerging vertical
- **Potential collaborators/hires**: Talent attraction
- **Referral sources**: Network building

### Key Voices to Engage

| Name | Why | Partnership Potential |
|------|-----|----------------------|
| Ethan Mollick | Most practical enterprise AI voice | High |
| swyx / Latent Space | Premier AI engineering podcast | High |
| Noah Brier / BRXND | Direct agency AI community | High |
| Hamel Husain | LLM implementation credibility | High |
| Simon Willison | Technical credibility, practical | Medium |

### Identified Gaps in the Space
- Health tech AI transformation voices (opportunity)
- Agency ops/workflow AI content (not just strategy)
- Design engineering intersection (SCTY differentiator)
- Mid-market focus (everyone talks enterprise or startup)
- Implementation case studies vs thought leadership

## The Meta-Narrative

> SCTY is a studio that builds AI products. GiveCare is our biggest bet. We also ship experiments, contribute to open-source, and occasionally help other companies do what we do.
