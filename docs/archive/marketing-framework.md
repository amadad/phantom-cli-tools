# Marketing Framework

**Philosophy**: Drive word-of-mouth growth by delivering genuinely useful, practical value—not marketing theater.

## The Heartbeat Framework

Marketing is a heartbeat. Big peaks followed by small peaks. The beat must never stop.

```
Momentum = Shipping + Talking About It
```

No heartbeat = invisible. Continuous communication creates the feeling of "always shipping."

## Content Hierarchy

| Tier | Type | Frequency | Effort | Impact |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| A | Launch Events | 2-3x/year | High | Highest |
| B | Mini-Launches | 4-5x/year | Medium | High |
| C | Changelog | 1-2x/month | Low | Medium |
| D | Blog | 1-2x/month | Medium | Medium |
| E | Stories | 1-2x/month | Medium | High |
| F | Social | Daily | Low | Cumulative |

### A) Launch Events
- Biggest "sign of life"
- 3-5 coordinated announcements in a week
- High coordination cost—used sparingly
- Align with industry moments (conferences, awareness months)

### B) Mini-Launches
- Smaller but meaningful wins
- Single feature, partnership, or milestone
- Blog post + social amplification

### C) Changelog
- Regular updates showing continuous evolution
- Demonstrates momentum even when nothing "big" ships
- Format: bullet list of improvements

### D) Blog
- Substantive content that builds authority
- Types: product updates, industry guides, philosophy/approach
- Not SEO-optimized filler—genuine expertise

### E) Stories
- Real stories from real users
- Attracts new users, motivates team
- Video or written format

### F) Social
- Primary platforms determined by audience
- Every post provides standalone value
- No "click to get the real value" patterns
- Reposts/engagement in afternoon

## Platform Philosophy

### Focus beats presence
Don't try to be everywhere. Pick 2-3 platforms and do them well.

### Calendar
- Goal: consistent posting (frequency varies by brand)
- Planning horizon: one week
- Calendar enforces consistency, not rigidity

### Posting Rules
1. Every post provides standalone value
2. Content useful even to non-users
3. Avoid excessive linking
4. Avoid thin promotion
5. Value embedded directly in post

---

## Email

Not everyone uses social media. Algorithms prevent reach.

### Newsletter
- Monthly minimum
- Content: product updates, changelogs, stories, launches
- For special events: increase frequency

### Principles
- Dogfood your own tools
- Segment audiences for relevance
- Respect inbox—only send when genuinely valuable

---

## Video

Invest in video as storytelling medium, not vanity metric.

### Quality over reach
- 120 views from the right audience > 20,000 from outside ICP
- Engagement quality matters more than reach

### Video Types
1. **Subject education**: Industry news, best practices, core concepts
2. **Product education**: Tutorials, end-to-end builds, integrations
3. **Culture**: Behind-the-scenes, founder Q&A, user interviews

### Sequence (content ladder)
1. Social post (validate interest)
2. Short-form video (1-2 min)
3. Long-form video (4-7 min) if warranted

---

## Website

A website tells a story—beginning, middle, end.

### Principles
- Substance over style (fancy without substance = car without engine)
- Values demonstrated, not declared
- Care and attention to detail (right users will notice)
- Playful and interactive (avoid walls of text)
- The website IS the sales team (self-serve adoption)

---

## Voice Principles (Universal)

### Simple
Get to the point. Avoid fluff, redundancy, ornamental language.

### Factual
Make claims you can prove. Broken claims destroy trust.

### Specific
Specificity builds credibility. Vague claims signal uncertainty.

---

## Anti-Goals

- Chasing followers/subscribers/views
- Over-promoting the company
- Disguising marketing as value
- Corporate speak
- Metrics without meaning

---

## Measurement

What matters:
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Engagement from ICP (not vanity metrics)
- Content-to-conversion paths
- Community sentiment

What doesn't:
- Raw follower counts
- Impressions without context
- Vanity shares from outside ICP
